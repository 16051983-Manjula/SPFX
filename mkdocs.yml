      author: Velin Georgiev
      summary: This sample shows how AppSettings.ts file can be added and used within SharePoint Framewrok webparts similar to the Web.config / App.config key value app settings in .NET Framework projects. That allows better DevOps and continuous integration (CI/CD) automation. The AppSettings.ts is transpiled/compiled with your SPFx solution which differs from the way the web.config. With .Net web.config file we would be able to update independently without the need of compiling DLLs. If that behavior is required, you can store your app settings in a SharePoint list and change them from there. However, that will have performance degradation over if the setting was part of the SPFx code where the logic can get a setting value in milliseconds.

      summary: The React Content Query WebPart is a modern version of the good old Content by Query WebPart that was introduced in SharePoint 2007. Built for SharePoint 2016 and Office 365, this modern version is built against the new SharePoint Framework (SPFx) and uses the latest Web Stack practices. While the original WebPart was based on a XSLT templating engine, this React WebPart is based on the well known Handlebars templating engine, which empowers users to create simple, yet powerfull HTML templates for rendering the queried content. This new version also lets the user query any site collections which resides on the same domain url, add unlimited filters, query DateTime fields to the nearest minute rather than being limited to a day, and much more.

      summary: React-multilist-grid is an SPFX webpart that uses React, Office-UI-Fabric, and Redux to let users edit list data from lists that reside in multiple webs and multiple sites in a single grid, similar to Quick Edit mode. The lists do not to be of the same type – you just need to create column mappings to tell the webpart which fields to show in which columns of the grid.

      summary: This sample uses the popular React Router library to create tab, multi-screen or single page app (spa) experience in React SPFx web part. This is useful when the web part is more complex and to simplify the user experience multiple screens or tabs are needed. The same approach can be taken when a single page app (SPA) has to be migrated to modern SharePoint sites.

      summary: This sample shows how we can use the ReactiveX (RxJs) library with the SharePoint Framework to communicate between web parts through broadcasting events utilizing the Publish–subscribe pattern. It enables a webpart or component to emit event (broadcast message) and that event is received by other web parts or components that have been subscribed to receive it. Please note this is custom implementation of the Publish–subscribe pattern by using the ReactiveX (RxJs) library. The SPFx will nativelly support this in future without the need of custom implementation through new SPFx api called Event Aggregator, but it is still in Alpha.
